# Introduction
This code is the prototipe/base for a new android app game. The **Bomb game**.

#Main idea
The **Bomb game** is a game app that intends to avoid the over use of the phone 
when in social reunions: meeting friends or family, at a restaurant, bar or party.

It could be interesting to test it in other events, like in a classroom or a 
talk (to limit the phone usage).

The game allows using the phone but it limits its usage, as the people
more prone to look at their phones will lose more points.

# How to develop code (good practices)

1. Use Android Studio
2. Look at the Issues in the Gitlab page.
3. Open issues for any problem you encounter.
4. Branch the code and do merge request.
5. Test the code that you implement (in a real phone if possible)
6. **Comment** all the code that you develop
